<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;">THE BIRTH OF SCIENCE,WHEN DARKNESS GAVE BIRTH TO LIGHT</h1>


<p><font size="10"face="gabriola"colour="orange">"In the beginning,there was a silence-an infinite void of nothingness.then in less then a heartbeat,fire was born.the universe erupted from a single point smaller than an atom,a blinding stormof energy and darkness colliding.from that chaos came stars,vast furnaces burning in the abbys,
creating the elements that would one day become oceans,mountains, and even life forms.for billions of years,the universe expanded like a breathing shadow,scattering galaxies across an endless night. and somewhere, on a tiny blue planet, life opened its eyes-curious,fragile,yet daring enough to ask the ultimate question
-why?science began the moment we reached into the unknown for answers, uncovering that the universe is not just vast,but starnger, darker and more mysterious then we can ever imagine"</font></p>
